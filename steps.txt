FOR MANDATORY
1. Check argv = 5
2. Check access of file1
3. Parse all paths and check to make sure they are all F_OK and X_OK
	-Can either use which path method or iterate through all paths method
	-Create a linked list of paths and commands
4. Pipe all commands

What happens if an invalid option is chosen?? 
	this will have to be taken care of in the execve part 
	in the parsing, we will only be checking to see if the main command is valid

Errors:
z: command not found
ls: invalid option -- 'z'
